            Handheld Daemon will manage the energy management settings.
            This includes CPU governor, CPU boost, GPU frequency, and CPU power preferences.
            At low TDPs, the CPU will be tuned down and at other TDPs, it will
            use balanced settings.

                Keep on balanced for good performance on all TDPs.

                Sets the minimum frequency for the CPU.
                Using 400MHz will save battery in light games.
                However, the delay of increasing the frequency
                may cause minor stutters, especially in VRR displays.
