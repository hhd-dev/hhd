    title: Standard Parameters
    hint: >-
      Standard TDP parameters for Ryzen processors. All need to be set to
      properly control the TDP of the device.

      Ryzen processors have 2 modes: STTv2 and STAPM (legacy). AMD suggests to 
      manufacturers to use STTv2, which makes the Legion Go the only device to 
      offer the STAPM alternative through a BIOS setting.

      In STTv2, the device will keep boosting until the "skin" of the device
      (hottest user accessible spot) reaches a manufacturer set temperature.
      Then, the device will use the Skin Temp TDP limit.
      In STAPM, the device averages the TDP values from the 1-3 previous minutes
      and keeps that value under the STAPM TDP limit.
      Either mode ignores the other mode's limit (STAPM limit does nothing on
      STT and Skin Temp Limit does nothing on STAPM), so both should be set.

      The Fast and Slow limits control boosting behavior.
      The Fast TDP limit is the actual max TDP value of the device.
      Then,the Slow TDP limit averages the last 10-20s of TDP values and keeps
      the value below it.

    # The Energy Policy is set automatically by the processor when connecting
    # to a charger.
    # It affects power consumption by around 2W, and its effect is mostly to
    # allow or block the processor from downclocking below 1.6GHz.
    # The battery profile was found to have an effect on VRR for the Ally.

    title: Advanced Parameters
    hint: >-
      The Advanced Parameters below control boosting behavior and need to be
      adjusted per device depending on its cooling system.
      They mostly affect boosting behavior, which is important for desktop use.

      The exception is the Temp Target (TCTL), which controls the max temperature
      of the CPU die. On most devices, it can safely be raised up to 100C. 
      However, if a temperature spike makes the chip reach 105C, it will enter
      a thermal protection mode, which is 5W, for a couple of minutes.

      The integration times for Slow TDP and STAPM influence how many previous
      TDP values the CPU will average to calculate its current Slow and STAPM 
      TDP values.
