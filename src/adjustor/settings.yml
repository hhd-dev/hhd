        Enables TDP management by the Handheld Daemon.
        While enabled, Handheld Daemon will set and maintain the TDP limits set
        on start-up and during other device changes (ac/dc).

        If the device crashes, TDP setting will be disabled on next startup.

        When this option is on, the settings will adhere to the limits set out
        by the device manufacturer, subject to their availability.

        With it off, the TDP settings ranges will expand to what is logically
        possible for the current device (regardless of manufacturer specifications).

        All settings outside specifications will be set to system specifications
        after rebooting.
