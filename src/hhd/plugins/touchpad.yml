    hint: >-
      Uses the touchpad of the emulated controller (if it exists).
      Otherwise, the touchpad remains unmapped (will still show up in the system).
      Meant to be used as steam input, so short press is unassigned by
      default and long press simulates trackpad click.

          The legion touchpad is square, whereas the DS5 one is rectangular.
          Therefore, it needs to be corrected.
          "Contain" maintain the whole DS5 touchpad and part of the Legion
          one is unused. "Crop" uses the full legion touchpad, and limits
          the area of the DS5. "Stretch" uses both fully (distorted).
          "Crop End" enables use in steam input as the right touchpad.
        options:
          stretch: "Stretch"
          crop_center: "Crop Center"
          crop_start: "Crop Start"

          Maps short touches (less than 0.2s) to a touchpad action.
          Dualsense uses a physical press for left and a double tap for
          right click (support for double tap varies; enable "Tap to Click"
          in your desktop's touchpad settings).
