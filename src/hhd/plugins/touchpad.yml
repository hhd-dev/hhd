      Adds an emulated touchpad. This touchpad is meant for use in gamescope
      and has left, right click support by default.
      However, it causes issues in desktop mode, and it doesnt allow dragging
      files. Therefore, it will autodisable in desktop.

      Uses the touchpad of the emulated controller (if it exists).
      Otherwise, the touchpad remains unmapped (will still show up in the system).
      Meant to be used as steam input, so short press is unassigned by
      default and long press simulates trackpad click.

          Controls the placement of the real touchpad to the virtual one, using
          what steam expects. In Steam, the "Left" touchpad maps to the left
          half, the "Right" touchpad maps to the right half, and "Center" maps
          to the whole touchpad.
          Therefore, the virtual touchpad is cropped to the left side for left,
          the right side for right, and expanded in the center for center.
          This means when set to center, half of the left touchpad is left and
          half of the right is right.
          "Stretch" stretches the touchpad to the whole dualsense surface.
        options:
          right: "Right"
          center: "Center"
          left: "Left"
          stretch: "Stretch"

          Maps short touches (less than 0.2s) to a touchpad action.
          Dualsense uses a physical press for left and a double tap for
