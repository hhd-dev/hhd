    title: Xbox
    hint: >-
      Creates a virtual `Handheld Daemon Controller` that can be used normally
      in apps. Back buttons are supported but steam will not detect them.
      If Gyroscope or Accelerometer are enabled, a Motion device will be
      created as well (experimental; works in Dolphin).

    title: Dualsense
    hint: >-
      Emulates the Dualsense Sony controller from the Playstation 5.
      Since this controller does not have paddles, the paddles are mapped
      to left and right touchpad clicks.

    children:
      led_support:
        type: bool
        title: LED Support
        hint: >-
          Passes through the LEDs to the controller, which allows games
          to control them.
        default: True
      
      paddles_to_clicks:
        type: bool
        title: Paddles to Clicks
        hint: >-
          Maps the paddles of the device to left and right touchpad clicks
          making them usable in Steam.
          If more than 2 paddles (e.g., Legion Go) uses the top ones.
          If extra buttons (e.g., Ayaneo, GPD), uses them instead.
        default: True

      sync_gyro:
        type: bool
        title: Gyro to Mouse Fix
        hint: >-
          In the latest steam update, `Gyro to Mouse [BETA]` misbehaves if a report is
          sent without a new imu timestamp.
          This option makes it so reports are sent only when there is a new
          gyro timestamp, effectively limiting the responsiveness of the
          controller to that of the IMU (e.g., for Legion Go 100hz instead of 400hz).
          If the IMU is not working, this setting will break the controller.
        default: False

      bluetooth_mode:
        type: bool
        title: Bluetooth Mode
        tags: [advanced]
        hint: >-
          Emulates the controller in bluetooth mode instead of USB mode.
          This is the default as it causes less issues with how apps
          interact with the controller.
          However, using USB mode can improve LED support (?) in some games.
          Test and report back!
        default: True

  dualsense_edge:

    tags: [lgc_emulation_dualsense_edge, dualsense_edge]
    title: Dualsense Edge
    hint: >-
      Emulates the expensive Dualsense Sony controller which enables paddle support.
      The edge controller is a bit obscure, so some games might not
      support it correctly.

    children:
      led_support:
        type: bool
