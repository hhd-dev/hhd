          Steam relies on the IMU timestamp for the touchpad as Mouse and `Gyro to Mouse [BETA]`.
          If the same timestamp is sent in 2 reports, this causes a division by 0 and instability.
          This option makes it so reports are sent only when there is a new
          IMU timestamp, effectively limiting the responsiveness of the
          controller to that of the IMU.
          This only makes a difference for the Legion Go (125hz), as all the other
          handhelds are using 400hz by default.

          Emulates the controller in bluetooth mode instead of USB mode.
          This is the default as it causes less issues with how apps
          interact with the controller.
          However, using USB mode can improve LED support (?) in some games.
          Test and report back!
