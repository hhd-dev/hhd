          Steam relies on the IMU timestamp for the touchpad as Mouse and `Gyro to Mouse [BETA]`.
          If the same timestamp is sent in 2 reports, this causes a division by 0 and instability.
          This option makes it so reports are sent only when there is a new
          IMU timestamp, effectively limiting the responsiveness of the
          controller to that of the IMU.
          This only makes a difference for the Legion Go (125hz), as all the other
          handhelds are using 400hz by default.
