  Allows for configuring the legion controllers using the built in firmware
  commands and enabling emulation modes for various controller types.

    title: X-input Emulation Mode
    hint: >-
      Emulate different controller types when the Legion Controllers are in X-Input mode.

        title: Dual Sense 5 Edge
        hint: >-
          Emulates the expensive DS5 Edge sony controller that maps 1-1 to
          the legion go.

            title: LED Support
            hint: >-
              Passes through the LEDs to the controller, which allows games

        title: Events Device
        hint: >-
          Creates a virtual `Handheld Daemon Controller` that can be used normally
          in apps. Back buttons are supported but steam will not detect them.
          If Gyroscope or Accelerometer are enabled, a Motion device will be
          created as well (experimental).

  # Common settings

  gyro:
    type: bool
    title: Gyroscope
    hint: >-
      Enables gyroscope support (.3% background CPU use)
    default: True
  accel:
    type: bool
    title: Accelerometer
    hint: >-
      Enables accelerometer support (CURRENTLY BROKEN; interferes with gyro; 
      if someone asks it will be fixed).
    default: False
  gyro_fix:
    type: discrete
    title: Gyro Fix (hz)
    hint: >-
      Adds polling to the legion go gyroscope, to fix the low polling rate
      (required for gyroscope support). Set to 0 to disable.
      Due to hardware limitations, there is a marginal difference above
      100hz.
    options: [0, 40, 60, 75, 100, 125, 200, 300]
    default: 100
  swap_legion:
    type: multiple
    title: Swap Legion Buttons with Start/Select
    hint: >-
      Swaps the legion buttons with start select.
    options:
      disabled: "Disabled"
      l_is_start: "Left is Start"
      l_is_select: "Left is Select"
    default: disabled
  share_to_qam:
    type: bool
    title: Map the Legion L button to QAM (instead of Mute)
    default: True
  touchpad_mode:
    type: multiple
    title: Touchpad correction type
    hint: >-
      The legion touchpad is square, whereas the DS5 one is rectangular.
      Therefore, it needs to be corrected.
      "Contain" maintain the whole DS5 touchpad and part of the Legion
      one is unused. "Crop" uses the full legion touchpad, and limits
      the area of the DS5. "Stretch" uses both fully (distorted).
      "Crop End" enables use in steam input as the right touchpad.
      Set to "Disabled" to not remap.
    options:
      disabled: "Disabled"
      stretch: "Stretch"
      crop_center: "Crop Center"
      crop_start: "Crop Start"
      crop_end: "Crop End"
      contain_start: "Contain Start"
      contain_end: "Contain End"
      contain_center: "Contain Center"
    default: crop_end

    default: False

  shortcuts:
    type: bool
    title: Enable Shortcuts Controller
    hint: >-
      When in other modes (dinput, dual dinput, and fps), enable a shortcuts 
      controller to restore Guide, QAM, and shortcut functionality.
    default: True
