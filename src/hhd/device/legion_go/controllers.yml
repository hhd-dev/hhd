  Allows for configuring the Legion controllers using the built in firmware
  commands and enabling emulation modes for various controller types.

  gyro:

    hint: >-
      Enables gyroscope support (.3% background CPU use)
    default: True
  accel:
    type: bool
    title: Accelerometer
    tags: [advanced]
    hint: >-
      Enables accelerometer support (CURRENTLY BROKEN; interferes with gyro; 
      if someone asks it will be fixed).
    default: False
  gyro_fix:
    type: discrete
    title: Gyro Fix (hz)
    hint: >-
      Adds polling to the legion go gyroscope, to fix the low polling rate
      (required for gyroscope support). Set to 0 to disable.
      Due to hardware limitations, there is a marginal difference above
      100hz.
    options: [0, 40, 60, 75, 100, 125, 200, 300]
    default: 100
  gyro_scaling:
    type: int
    title: Gyro Scale
    hint: >-
      Applies a scaling factor to the legion go gyroscope (since it is misconfigured
      by the driver). Try different values to see what works best.
      Low values cause a deadzone and high values will clip when moving the 
      Go abruptly.

          Adds an emulated touchpad. This touchpad is meant to be for desktop

          Otherwise, the touchpad remains unmapped (will still show up in the system).
          Meant to be used as steam input, so short press is unassigned by
          default and long press simulates trackpad click.

            hint: >-
              The legion touchpad is square, whereas the DS5 one is rectangular.
              Therefore, it needs to be corrected.
              "Contain" maintain the whole DS5 touchpad and part of the Legion
              one is unused. "Crop" uses the full legion touchpad, and limits
              the area of the DS5. "Stretch" uses both fully (distorted).
              "Crop End" enables use in steam input as the right touchpad.
            options:
              stretch: "Stretch"

              Maps short touches (less than 0.2s) to a touchpad action.
              Dualsense uses a physical press for left and a double tap for
